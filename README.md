**Credit Card Approval Prediction**

## Summary
This project develops a machine learning model to predict whether a credit card application should be approved, based on demographic and financial data. Using the UCI Credit Approval dataset, it streamlines the application process by reducing manual reviews and improving decision consistency.

## Dataset

- **Source:** UCI ML Repository  
- **Size:** 690 applications  
- **Features:** Mix of categorical and numerical attributes (e.g., age, employment, housing)  
- **Target:** Approval (`+`) or Denial (`â€“`)  
- **Missing Values:** Handled via imputation  

## Methodology

1. Load and explore data  
2. Clean and preprocess (handle missing data, encode categorical features)  
3. Scale features and split dataset  
4. Train models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest)  
5. Evaluate using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix  
6. (Optional) Deploy via API or web form
